🏷️ Inventory Management & Stock Optimization Analysis

Industry: Retail / Supply Chain (Sportswear – Nike India)
Type of Analysis: Exploratory & Diagnostic Inventory Analysis

1️⃣ Executive Summary

Nike operates across multiple warehouses and cities in India, managing thousands of SKUs daily. Inefficient inventory planning can lead to capital lock-in, overstocking, and stockout risks, directly impacting profitability and operational efficiency.

In this project, I analyzed 1 year of inventory transaction data across India to evaluate inventory health, demand movement, and replenishment effectiveness. Using Excel-based analytics and dashboards, I identified slow-moving inventory risks, overstock concentration, and high-priority replenishment locations.

🔑 Key Outcomes

₹2,105.78 Cr total inventory analyzed

51% of inventory value is at risk (primarily due to overstock)

₹1,015.91 Cr locked in slow-moving SKUs

20,793 SKU–warehouse combinations require replenishment review

49% of SKUs are slow moving, indicating excess assortment depth

🚀 Business Impact

This analysis highlights opportunities to:

Reduce excess inventory

Improve demand-based stocking

Optimize replenishment decisions across regions

2️⃣ Business Problem

Inventory mismanagement is one of the biggest hidden cost drivers in retail supply chains.

Nike faces challenges such as:

Overstocking slow-moving products

Capital being blocked in non-performing SKUs

Difficulty prioritizing replenishment across multiple cities

Limited visibility into inventory health at scale

❓ What this project aims to solve

Which inventory is healthy vs at risk?

Which SKUs are slow vs fast moving?

Where is inventory value concentrated geographically?

Which locations need immediate replenishment action?

This project focuses on diagnosing inventory inefficiencies rather than forecasting, enabling data-driven operational decisions.

3️⃣ Methodology
📊 Analysis Approach

Exploratory & diagnostic analysis of daily inventory transactions

Product–warehouse level analysis for accuracy

Demand velocity–based inventory classification

🧠 Key Techniques Used

Inventory metrics: Opening stock, closing stock, received qty, sold qty

Reorder logic using Safety Stock + Lead Time

Demand analysis using Average Daily Sales

Inventory movement classification:

Fast Moving

Slow Moving

Risk identification:

Overstock

Stockout risk

Healthy stock

📈 Dashboards

KPI-driven Excel dashboard with slicers (City, Region, Category)

Pivot-based aggregation for transparency and auditability

The focus was on clarity, correctness, and business interpretability, not visual gimmicks.

4️⃣ Skills Used
🧮 Excel (Core)

Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

GETPIVOTDATA for dynamic KPIs

VLOOKUP / structured references

Conditional logic (IF, nested IFs)

Inventory calculations & business metrics

Dashboard design with slicers

📦 Supply Chain Concepts

Inventory valuation

Reorder point logic

Safety stock & lead time

Inventory aging & movement analysis

Demand-based decision making

(SQL, Power BI, and Python are planned extensions for future iterations of this project.)

5️⃣ Results & Business Recommendations
📌 Key Findings

Overstock is a bigger issue than stockouts, indicating capital inefficiency

Slow-moving SKUs exist consistently across warehouses, pointing to product-level demand issues

South and West regions hold the highest inventory value concentration

Replenishment pressure is distributed across major cities, not isolated to one location

✅ Recommendations

Reduce stock depth for slow-moving SKUs
Adjust reorder quantities to prevent further overstock accumulation.

Reallocate inventory from high-overstock regions
Optimize inter-warehouse transfers based on demand velocity.

Prioritize fast-moving SKUs for replenishment
Ensure availability of high-demand products to avoid revenue loss.

Adopt movement-based inventory reviews
Move beyond last-sale logic to demand-driven inventory monitoring.

6️⃣ Next Steps & Limitations
🔮 Next Steps

If given more time and access:

Implement the same model using SQL for scalable querying

Build a Power BI dashboard with real-time refresh and drill-downs

Add forecasting models for proactive inventory planning

Introduce SKU rationalization analysis to reduce assortment complexity

⚠️ Limitations

Dataset is simulated and does not include promotions or seasonality

No supplier-side constraints or cost variations included

Forecasting and profitability analysis are outside the current scope

Despite these limitations, the project effectively demonstrates inventory diagnostics and decision-making logic applicable to real-world retail operations.

📌 Conclusion

This project showcases how structured analysis and clear KPIs can uncover hidden inefficiencies in inventory operations. Rather than focusing on tools alone, the emphasis is on business understanding, correct metrics, and actionable insights—skills essential for a data analyst working in supply chain or retail analytics.
